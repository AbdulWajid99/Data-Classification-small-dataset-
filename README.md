# Data-Classification-small-dataset-
Cassifying images as dogs or cats,focusing on better accuracy for small datasets.
Since small dataset leads to data overfitting or leading to bad classification accuracy around 71%.
To tackle this problem i have used data augmentation, a powerful technique for mitigating overfitting but this will only lead to about an accuracy of 82%
So, i used feature extraction with a pretrained network and fine-tuning which lead me to whooping 97% accuracy.
